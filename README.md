- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Chaplin, Front-End Engineer and occasional AUV Pilot at the National Oceanography Centre, UK.
- ðŸš€ Former International Karate Instructor; Military Analyst; Prisonser Custody Officer; English Teacher; Bar Manager. Basically I want to see and experience as much as I can in life, make a mark on this world and do those things that really interest me. Discovered coding later on and couldn't be happier that I did.
- ðŸŽ“ I originally learned web development from the excellent [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s full stack developer course. Currrently experimenting with various business ideas and learning Data Science and Machine Learning in my free time.
