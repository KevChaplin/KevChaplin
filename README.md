- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Chaplin, Full-Stack Engineer at TI Tokyo.
- ðŸš€ Former International Karate Instructor; Military Analyst; Prisonser Custody Officer; English Teacher; Bar Manager. Basically I want to see and experience as much as I can in life, make a mark on this world and do those things that really interest me. Discovered coding later on and couldn't be happier that I did.
- ðŸŽ“ I learned web development from the excellent [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s full stack developer course. I will continue to learn from them, moving on to the Python, Data Science and Machine Learning modules in the near future.
