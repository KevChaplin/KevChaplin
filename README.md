- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin Chaplin, Full-Stack Engineer.
- 🚀 Former International Karate Instructor; Military Analyst; Prisonser Custody Officer; English Teacher; Bar Manager. Basically I want to see and experience as much as I can in life, make a mark on this world and do those things that really interest me. Discovered coding later on and couldn't be happier that I did.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a front-end/full-stack web developer role.
- 🎓 I learned web development from the excellent [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s full stack developer course. I will continue to learn from them, moving on to the Python, Data Science and Machine Learning modules in the near future.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on open source projects using the MERN stack.
- 📫 Reach me on <kevchaplin44@gmail.com>
